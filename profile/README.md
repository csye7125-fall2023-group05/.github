The orchestration of distributed systems using Kubernetes involving utilization of a set of reusable and generic software design patterns. These patterns include the Sidecar pattern, Ambassador pattern, Adapter pattern, Event-Driven architecture, Stream and Batch Processing, Containers and Container Orchestration, Replication, Partitioning, Transactions, Consistency, and Consensus. This approach aims to enhance the accessibility and efficiency of developing reliable distributed systems.

The project aims to help build skills to develop applications for hybrid cloud and run existing monolithic applications side by side with microservices without a complete rewrite.
